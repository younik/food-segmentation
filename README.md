# Food Segmentation Challenge

## Overview
This work was a part of a university project. We have trained a U-Net and a SegNet from scratch to perform semantic segmentation on food photos.
You can find the dataset on the [page of the competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/food-recognition-challenge) and more info on the [report](https://github.com/younik/food-segmentation/blob/main/report.pdf). 

## Problem Statement
The goal of this challenge is to train models which can look at images of food items and detect the individual food items present in them. We use a novel dataset of food images collected through the MyFoodRepo app where numerous volunteer Swiss users provide images of their daily food intake in the context of a digital cohort called Food & You. This growing data set has been annotated - or automatic annotations have been verified - with respect to segmentation, classification (mapping the individual food items onto an ontology of Swiss Food items), and weight/volume estimation.

This is an evolving dataset, where we will release more data as the dataset grows over time.
